== Newly added entpoints ==

New endpoints added : 

- Frankfurt, Germany
- Ukraine

== Free Content Delivery Network for your Static Content ==

[Shift8](https://www.shift8web.ca) has rolled out a consistently-growing CDN with endpoints all over the world. This plugin will make your site load way faster by using latency-based and geographic-based DNS resolution for requests made to your site to be served by an endpoint closest to the user making the request. This means that a user making a request in Mumbai, India will hit the Mumbai server to download the static content from your website, improving performance remarkably.

Current endpoints in use (more added regularly) :

1. USA - Northern California
2. USA - Northern Virginia
3. USA - Dallas, TX
4. USA - Miami, FL
5. Canada - Toronto
6. Europe - London, England 
7. Europe - Stockholm, Sweden
8. Europe - Warsaw, Poland
9. Europe - Frankfurt, Germany
10. Europe - Ukraine
11. Asia Pacific - Hong Kong, China
12. Asia Pacific - Tokyo, Japan
13. Asia Pacific - Sydney, Australia
14. Asia Pacific - Singapore
15. Asia Pacific - Mumbai, India
16. Latin America - Sao Paulo, Brazil

You can learn more about how the CDN was setup and how it works by reading our [blog post](https://www.shift8web.ca/2019/05/how-we-created-our-own-free-content-delivery-network-for-wordpress-users/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I tested it on my site and its not working for me! =

Send us an email to cdnhelp@shift8web.com or post in the support forums here and we will help. We are constantly improving and updating the plugin also!

= I noticed on lazy load images, the CDN isnt being used =

This is a known issue with how lazy loading is implemented in some scenarios. Currently if you want the CDN to be used for lazy load images, you have to turn lazy load off.
